<h1>Mirror Eye</h1>
<h2>
Mirror Eye (1999) is distinct, different than many other pieces around it. This is partly because it was created not by Dr. Evermor, but by Jake Furnald, a local artist, and partly because Mirror Eye is not a time traveling device, an intergalactic visitor or even a creature of any sort. Instead, it’s a map—or, more precisely, a model.
<br><br>
The Mirror Eye was born from Dr. Evermor’s vision of what could be done with the closed Badger Army Ammunition Plant. The plant, located just south of the Baraboo Hills, had opened during World War II to produce wartime materials such as propellant for cannons, rockets, and small arms ammunition. During World War II, it grew to be the largest munitions factory in the world. Employing tens of thousands of people through the years, it continued operation until 1975. By the late 1990s, stakeholders and community members locally and regionally began proposing ideas on how to reuse the land and facility, the discussion growing heated.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Dr. Evermor had plans of his own. He envisioned a large, attractive sculpture park for his work that also served as a meaningful memorial to wartime workers. Around this time, Jake Furnald, then a sculpture student at Beloit College, began visiting the Park. Doc shared with Jake his vision for the Badger Army Ammunition Plant. The Forevertron would be at the center of a massive park, surrounded by a reflecting pool, blended together with some of the old buildings. The other pieces Doc had created would be arranged within the Park also. Doc asked Jake first to draw and then to make a metal model of his plans which he had begun calling Mirror Eye. Dr. Evermor explained that the name signified how there were forces looking out from the park as well as forces looking down on it. Doc intended the design to be visible from space.

While Dr. Evermor’s plans for the plant did not come to fruition, Mirror Eye still sits in the Art Park, a tribute to Doc’s bold vision.
