The Bird Band (1995-1998) is a vast and complex collection made up of over seventy pieces. Most of the birds stand just taller than the average adult and hold an instrument. Instruments in the band include French horns, chimes, trombones, trumpets, steel drums, “Tibetan” bells, gongs, marimbas, baritones, tubas, and all kinds of horns.

Doc chose birds for his band because they are a peaceful, harmonious species that symbolize the power to fly above the weight and struggles of life. The Bird Band adds festivity and celebration, humor and creativity to the time travel experience—and to the Art Park. When the Forevertron powers up, the birds sense the energy and gather the loose strands of it from the air to wake from their slumber and revitalize themselves.

Built in the 1990s, the birds are made from stainless steel, steel and copper. Many of the feathers come from rejected blades of the Fiskars Company. Lady Eleanor discovered the first few instruments at a local St. Vincent de Paul store and purchased them. Forming an idea, Doc returned to the store and asked if there were any more. He soon learned that the store had a large collection of instruments, castaways from a high school band that was trying to clear out their supply of damaged and unusable instruments. Doc called on his best bargaining skills and ended up leaving with every instrument they had. Larry Waller, a friend and fellow salvager, later supplied the horn bells that he had gotten from a horn manufacturer.

Besides the regular birds in the band, there are several distinct birds in the group. The largest bird in the Bird Band is the Fiddle Bird, sometimes also called Fides Gravis, Banjo Bird, or Ukulele Bird. Originally a set of two, the second Fiddle Bird was sold to American Visionary Arts Museum in Baltimore, Maryland. At 38 feet tall, the Fiddle Bird, located toward the back of the band, towers over all the other pieces. The main body of the bird is made from a Hubbard tank that had been used for burn patients.

The Mangascar Birds are a unique and important part of the band. At 14 feet tall, these birds are also significantly taller than the majority of the birds. Their name, of course, is derived from Madagascar. This is an important connection to Dr. Every because Madagascar was a safe haven for Henry Every, the well-known pirate, and a distant ancestor of Doc. Similarly, these birds, with their special healing power, became a safe haven of sorts for Doc who created them during a dark time in his life. While working, he reflected on the people who had influenced his life for good through the years—particularly in his youth. He called on their goodness to light his way. Then he carved their names in the bases of the birds. The healing powers of the birds can be felt by all who visit.

The most important bird in the band is the Director Bird. This bird was built as a “portrait” of Dan Woolpert—and is the only portrait Doc has ever attempted. Dan was the director of the First Brigade Band, a band centered in Watertown, Wisconsin that dresses in period costumes and travels throughout the region giving performances of Civil War era music on authentic instruments from that era. The first time Dr. Evermor attended one of their concerts, he was transformed by the experience. As he walked among the players, he could feel the power of their true spirits and pure hearts. This spirit was channeled into their music, giving it an intense power and energy. Doc had felt this same energy while creating his band, and wanted to make sure it was conveyed through the Bird Band’s music. He modeled the Director Bird after Dan, hoping it would help the Bird Band members replicate the same energy Dan extracted from the members of the Brigade band. At the Park, the Director Bird stands facing his band, a large music stand in front of him, a baton in each hand, a flat hat on his bird head.

Other birds in the Bird Band have unique roles. Near the Director Bird you can find two Speaker Birds. Their job, of course, is to amplify the sounds of the music so everyone can hear it. Additionally, the Guard Birds fill the important role of keeping the band safe from any intruders who might threaten it—whether they be from this world or from another world.
