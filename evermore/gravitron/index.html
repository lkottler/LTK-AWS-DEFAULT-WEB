<h1>The Gravitron</h1>
<h2>
Traveling through time and space is a dangerous business. Because of this, a traveler must take certain preparations to ensure his safety. That’s where Gravitron comes in. Before entering the travel chamber in the Forevertron, all travelers must first pass through this handy device.
<br><br>
The copper egg travel chamber in the Forevertron has a strict weight limit of 150 pounds. This is partly because of the size of the copper egg and partly because the amount of energy needed to break free from our time and space realm in order to enter others increases with weight. Dr. Evermor himself does not meet this weight requirement and therefore needed to come up with a solution. He built the Gravitron as a “de-watering” device—a way to shrink down a person’s body until he met the specifications. The Gravitron also conducts further analysis and measurements on the traveler and corrects any defects. 
<br><br>
Operating like an MRI, the Gravitron conducts a thorough full body scan. The scanning device is an old X-ray machine that came from a doctor in Madison who was storing it in his garage. He made Dr. Evermor promise never to use it for X-rays before allowing him to take it. 
<br><br>
The Gravitron does more than correct any defects in the traveler’s body. It also serves to concentrate energy into the traveler. The copper dome on top, which came from a copper vat at a chocolate factory, streamlines energy toward the traveler and back into the Gravitron itself. The cables attached to the dome catch any escaping energy or any energy loose in the surrounding air. 
<br><br>
The Gravitron draws on the electromagnetic force of the Forevertron to power itself. It can be turned on by switches found on the machine. However, to operate correctly, the switches must be carefully managed to ensure that the right blend of electrical and magnetic forces flows into the Gravitron. This is usually done by Nabu, an intergalactic extraterrestrial who lives in a human body, working as a scientist here on Earth. If Nabu is not available, others can be trained to perform his duties.
