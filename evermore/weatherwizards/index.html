Tucked away at the Art Park stand more than a dozen Weather Wizards (1985). Each Wizard is strikingly unique, both in appearance and in personality, and in fact has its own name. The Wizards come in a variety of sizes, some only a couple of feet tall, while others are taller than any human. The most distinct part of the Wizards are their expressive faces, many of which have large, conspicuous eyes. Many of the Wizards have moving parts, particularly arms and hands that can rotate.

Since each Wizard has a unique appearance, each is also comprised of unique materials. Some of the Wizards have Sumo Wrestlers, a sculpture that also exists as a small independent sculpture, as their hands. Some have camshafts for hair. Survey markers were often used to make those large eyes. A variety of materials like gears of different sizes, giant bearings and train springs form the bodies.

The Weather Wizards got their name because of their ability to read the weather, not just around them at the Art Park, but also intergalactically and even in other time realms. Dr. Evermor relies on this important skill to ensure the safety of his travel. He consults with the Weather Wizards prior to his departure to learn if any space storms along his path or dangerous weather at his intended destination will interfere with his trip. Many of the Weather Wizards stand with their arms extended in order to read the energy and other signs always imbedded in the wind when it blows through. The Wizards work as a team, each with a slightly different weather-reading specialty, which combine together to give Doc a thorough assessment of the conditions and risks.
