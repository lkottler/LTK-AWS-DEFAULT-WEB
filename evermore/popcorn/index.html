Olfactory Popcorn Popper (1992)
The Epicurean Grill might be the center of the party, but it isn’t the only sculpture at the Art Park to be part of the fun. Dr. Evermor built other items to help with the food and entertainment. After all, in the festive atmosphere of time travel, hamburgers and hotdogs wouldn’t be enough. That’s why the Art Park needed the Olfactory Popcorn Popper. As Doc says, you can’t really have a good time without popcorn. He even fondly refers to the Olfactory as his “smell sculpture.” Dr. Evermor and Lady Eleanor often pop up batches of popcorn in the Olfactory during parties of all sorts at the Art Park.

The main body of the Olfactory is an elevator cage that Doc got from his friend, Larry Waller. Larry had been keeping the cage, which he had obtained from a salvage job in Elgin, Illinois, as well as the speaker that became the Celestial Listening Ears on his front lawn—believing them to be art by themselves. Doc made him an offer and went home with both pieces. Doc added an antique popcorn popper to the elevator cage as well a couple of chairs that people could sit in to run the machine. Then he attached some bric-a-brac for decoration, put it on thick metal limousine springs and it was ready to go!

Chee-Schwer (1992)
The Chee-Schwer performs a practical function—while still retaining a visually appealing exterior. It provides the refrigeration for the meat and accompanying items for the Epicurean Grill. The Chee-Schwer is built from an antique refrigerator, salvaged storage tank and a cart. Like the grill, it’s set on wheels, making it simple to relocate it wherever it’s most needed.
