<h1>Entertaining at the Art Park: Places to Relax</h1>

With so much to see at the Art Park, Dr. Evermor expected that visitors might need a quiet place to rest for a moment. He also realized that with all the festivities at the Art Park, guests would need places to sit together and eat. So Dr. Evermor built them some very special accommodations to do this.
<br><br>
Gazebos
<br>
As you wander through the Art Park, you’ll notice several gazebos. White with thin curving lines, they look somehow graceful and almost fragile. The gazebo on wheels was originally made to be a mobile wedding chapel—and it saw many weddings under its roof. This gazebo also spent a number of years in Mississippi where it even managed to survive a hurricane intact. With the swirling, geometrical metal working around the top, it’s not hard to see what would attract couples to this beautiful piece. And Doc likes to tell people that couples who marry here stay together!
<br><br>
The largest gazebo in the Park has a name—Fancy, the name of the ship of Dr. Evermor’s seventeenth century pirate ancestor, Captain Henry Every. Carved into the cement are the words “Power On”, reminiscent of the Forevertron. An opening in the top of the gazebo lets sunlight filter in. Around the perimeter sit seven cherubs, placed there for protection. A third white gazebo is striking for the collection of large wind chimes hanging underneath.
<br><br>
Tables and Chairs
<br>
Besides the seating found under the gazebos, there are some other table and chair sets in the Art Park. More than just functional, these tables and chairs are works of art in their own right. A set of tall tables are actually creatures with long legs and gears for bodies under the tabletop. Their long necks reach upward, topped with the same intergalactic catlike faces found on the Sea Cats that arrived on the Gyromni, now gathered elsewhere in the Park.

The other sets you’ll find throughout the Art Park are low-lying tables and chairs—with six chairs around each table. The true nature of these creatures posing as chairs can be seen near their bases. Their gold eyes, made from drapery rods, bug out, attached to the end of springs. Rotary hoes, with their curved spokes radiating outward, give the creatures an insect-like appearance. The seats themselves are tractor seats, painted in bright colors. The table in the middle has a set of eyes sticking out on springs near the ground. Aaron Howard worked with Doc on these sets also.
