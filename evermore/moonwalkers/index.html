You might not notice them on your first glimpse of the Forevertron. But if you walk a little closer, you’re bound to catch sight of the Moonwalkers, dozens of small, extraterrestrial creatures, standing around the perimeter of the Forevertron, like guards on their watch. And in some ways, that’s exactly what they are. The Moonwalkers’ duty is to watch over the Forevertron, ensuring it stays at its optimal performance level at all times.
<br><br>	
It’s easy to see from the faces of the Moonwalkers that there is nothing menacing about their watch, though. Even in the day while they are still, you can sense their friendly spirits. They stand on six spindly legs, something that gives them an insect-like look. Yet their large, round eyes in their hollow egg-shaped eye sockets show their deeper intelligence. While they may sit unmoving in the daylight, their intent eyes are observing, taking everything in as people walk by.

The Moonwalkers were called here to Earth by the special level 7 energy waves of the Forevertron, an energy type to which they are naturally sensitive. They came back with Dr. Evermor on one of his journeys and have been at the Art Park ever since. When the sun sets at the Art Park, the Moonwalkers shake off their restful state and get to work—particularly if it was a day of time or space travel for Dr. Evermor. Sometimes they work alongside the Intergalactic Time Travelers. Yet each of these intergalactic beings have a distinct responsibility. The Time Travelers concentrate mostly on fixing the mechanics of the Forevertron while the Moonwalkers focus on making sure the energy of the Forevertron is flowing correctly and in adequate supply.
