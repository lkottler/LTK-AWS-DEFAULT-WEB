<h1>Celestial Listening Ears</h1>
<h2>
The Celestial Listening Ears (mid 1980s) play a unique part in time and space traveling adventures. In order to launch the travel chamber egg in the correct direction towards its destination in space, the control crew must rely on communication from the heavens. This communication comes through the Celestial Listening Ears. When a traveler is ready to launch, two aids take their seats in the Celestial Listening Ears’ metal chair. This chair was originally located in a dentist office, then widened to be large enough for two people in order to fill its role here.
<br><br>
Once seated, the aids put on earphones which connect to the speaker above them. They listen for voices from space which can only be heard through the Celestial Listening Ears. The large ear part of the device was a speaker in a theater in Beloit, Wisconsin. Dr. Evermor recognized its potential immediately when a new acquaintance took him to his home to see the speaker which he had been keeping on his front lawn. Dr. Evermor realized this speaker possessed a special property. Originally designed to produce sound, with a careful reversal of some parts, it could be used to instead receive sound. The Celestial Listening Ears are able to collect the faint yet distinct sounds waves that come from space and amplify them so that human ears can detect them. To use the Celestial Listening Ears most effectively, the aids with the earphones sometimes give instructions to additional aids who stand at the side and use a hand crank to rotate the reversed speaker to the most advantageous angle.
<br><br>
After picking up the voices from space, the aids scan the sky with the attached telescopes, searching for clues to the locations of the sources of these voices. These telescopes are specially designed to identify UFOs or other signs of extraterrestrial activity. Once the aids find these signs, they plot coordinates to pinpoint their location. They communicate this to the Master Control Aid working in the Overlord Master Control Tower. The Master Control Aid can then direct the launching of the travel chamber egg to aim towards these voices, maximizing the egg’s chances of reaching its desired destination and connecting with extraterrestrials.
