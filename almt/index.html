<h1>Albert Mellentine</h1>
<h2>
It’s very important to Dr. Evermor that the power supplied to the Forevertron be consistent and adequate. Otherwise, his time traveling adventure could end in disaster. Because of that, he has gone to great lengths to ensure there are several types of back-up power available, such as the Juicer Bug which stores lightning power. The Albert Mellentine is another storage venue for back-up power.   
<br><br>
The Albert Mellentine is named after the truck’s original owner, someone Doc never met but still recognized as a kindred spirit. Albert had reused and rebuilt things throughout his life, finding new, improved uses for many items. He remade the engine for this tow truck, using a nine-cylinder Guiberson radial engine from a World War II tank, 1929 vintage gasoline Franklyn engine and two streetcar motors among other things. The result was so powerful that Albert affectionately called it “the Monster.” Dr. Evermor saw other purposes for the truck though.
<br><br>
Dr. Evermor first acquired the truck in 1965 by trading 1100 sheets of plywood for it. Doc only had it a short time before he sold it at an auction. Twenty years later he came across it again in a junkyard near Tomah looking just as he remembered—except with the addition of a tree growing right through the middle of it. This time, Dr. Evermor felt the special energy this truck had and knew it could play an important role in his Forevertron collection. So he decided to buy it back. 
<br><br>
To spruce up the Albert Mellentine’s appearance, Doc added a very distinct roof with a red and white canopy that his wife, Lady Eleanore, had made. He also attached two giant red metal balls to the rear. Dr. Evermor bought the metal balls, which weigh 800 pounds each, in Mississippi. They had originally been used in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Although Doc got the balls for a great price, getting his new purchases (he bought 28 in all) home without breaking his truck was a challenge. Once at home, Doc painted two of the balls red. The original owner had called the truck his “little cherry picker”, so Doc attached these really big cherries to the truck in Albert’s honor!
