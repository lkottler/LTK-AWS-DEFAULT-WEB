<h1>Entertaining at the Art Park: Epicurean Grill</h1>
<h2>
The Epicurean Grill (1977) isn’t part of the logistics or mechanics of time and space travel. Instead, it plays an important role in celebrations that take place when Dr. Evermore launches into space from the Forevertron. Its main purpose is simple: to make people happy. And because of that, it might be Doc’s favorite work.
<br><br>
Dr. Evermor originally built the Epicurean Grill for his wife, Lady Eleanor. At one point, there were plans to include it in The House on the Rock, a tourist attraction near Spring Green, Wisconsin built by Alex Jordan, whom Doc worked with for years. In the end though, Dr. Evermor felt it could do the most good as part of the Art Park. An actual working grill, the Epicurean Grill can cook up some of the tastiest hot dogs and hamburgers around—something needed to keep the crowds that come to watch Doc’s take-offs satisfied and content.
<br><br>
Everything about the Epicurean Grill is festive. Lady Eleanor sewed the red and white canopy that hangs up in the front. And a sign with orange letters displays its name for all to see. One of the most striking parts of it is the huge bellows that Dr. Evermor got from a blacksmith shop in Brooklyn, Wisconsin, used to keep the grill hot while cooking.

Other parts of the Epicurean Grill come from across the state of Wisconsin. The center column comes from the People’s Brewery in Oshkosh. The Island Woolen Mill in Baraboo was the original owner of the tapered copper sleeve where it was part of a dye vat. The brass trim came from an industrial stamping mistake. Doc salvaged cypress from water towers in Pet Milk plant in New Glarus to build the decking and located antique railroad hinges to create hinges on the cabinet of the Epicurean Grill. Other pieces came from even further out than Wisconsin. Brew kettle valves, copper floats and bridge trusses are from Iowa and Doc even used a whiskey barrel he got in Kentucky. The grill was built on a Buick Chassis with 30 inch wheels so it could be moved from place to place as needed.
